Dashboard Description:

The MovieMate dashboard offers a comprehensive platform for exploring the world of film through data-driven insights and analytics. Designed with the user experience of everybody from film enthusiasts to industry professionals in mind, MovieMate provides insights for answering key questions about movie trends, ratings, genres, and collaborations. Whether you're a passionate movie buff looking for new recommendations or a film industry insider seeking actionable insights, MovieMate provides valuable tools and resources to enhance both the movie-watching experience and decision-making process.

Dashboard Building Process:

Building the MovieMate dashboard was an challenging journey that involved leveraging various data science concepts and techniques to create a user-friendly and informative dashboard. I started by selecting and cleaning a rich dataset sourced from FilmTV, a reputable platform similar to IMDb, containing information on over 40,000 movies. In developing the dashboard, I utilized a number of Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, Dash, and Plotly Express to analyze, visualize, and present the data in an intuitive manner in order to make the dashboard as user-friendly as possible.

One of the key features of MovieMate is its interactive visualization components, including stacked bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, carousels, and heatmaps. These data visualizations enable users to explore trends in movie genres over time, analyze actor collaborations, compare ratings across different genres, and discover new movies through an engaging carousel interface. Additionally, I have implemented features such as dropdown menus, range sliders, and search functionality in order to enhance the dashboard's usability and interactivity.

Throughout the dashboard building process, I encountered various challenges and opportunities for learning. Having little prior coding experience and no experience with data analysis whatsoever, I dedicated a lot of time to strengthening those skills, taking advantage of the numerous resources provided. I found the most difficult bugs to fix were those relating to the layout and functionality of the dashboard rather than coding errors. If I were to estimate, I likely spent around 30% of my time coding the dashboard components and layout, while 70% of my time was allotted to debugging code and getting everything to run smoothly. Through this experience, I honed my skills not just in data analysis, but in visualization design, web application development, and optimizing dashboard performance. Overall, I believe that MovieMate showcases my ability to translate complex data into actionable insights, demonstrating my ability to quickly become proficient in data science, visualization, and coding.

Strengths and Learning Experiences:

MovieMate not only showcases my technical skills in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard development but also highlights my proficiency in project management and adaptability. Throughout the development process, I adhered to the project timeline and sprint schedules, ensuring timely delivery of each milestone. Further, my ability to prioritize tasks, set achievable goals, and utilize resources effectively enabled myself to stay on track and meet project deadlines consistently.

Moreover, I demonstrated adaptability and flexibility in responding to unforeseen challenges while developing my dashboard. Notably, I overestimated the amount of space I would have in the width of my dashboard, requiring a complete pivot in the layout. As I progressed through each sprint, I remained open to feedback, adjusting my approach as needed to ensure alignment with project objectives and expectations.

By managing the project timeline and adapting to evolving needs, I demonstrated the ability to navigate complex projects successfully. It showcases my resilience and capacity to overcome obstacles while maintaining a focus on delivering high-quality results. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also honed my soft skills, such as communication and problem-solving, which are invaluable in any professional setting.

NOTE: I was unable to attach the original dataset because the file was too large for GitHub. For that reason, I simply uploaded the cleaned dataset used for my app rather than the original dataset and the data cleaning file.
